      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Dudley is a web content generation engine suitable for
        building blogs, informational sites and even simple
        interactive applications. It is a little
        like <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, but
        easier to update and works well with version control systems
        like <code>git</code> or <code>svn</code>. Your whole team can
        easily collaborate and test your site before it goes live.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of dynamically generating a web page every time a user
        visits your site, Dudley generates static HTML files you can
        serve off less capable (and less expensive) servers.
        <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars.JS</a>, the
        templating engine Dudley uses, is extensible so you have a
        little flexibility when you find you've coded yourself into a
        corner.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Dudley uses standard web technologies like HTML5, CSS and
        client-side JavaScript. But it can easily be extended to use
        LESS, SASS, CoffeeScript or whatever HTML5 toolset you're
        using. It is framework-agnostic, working equally well with
        Bootstrap, Angular.JS, Backbone, Ember or SproutCore. The
        static content it generates can even be imported back into
        WordPress, Drupal and even Microsoft SharePoint (with 3rd
        party tools.)
